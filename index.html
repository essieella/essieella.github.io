<h2 id="union-market">Union Market</h2>
<ul>
<li>5 stars: food quality</li>
</ul>
<p>I have never had any horribly tasting food there. The empanadas that I had in Union Market were scrumptious.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 stars: affordability</li>
</ul>
<p>The price is steep. 10 dollars for three empanadas is pricey. Even their vending machine products were expensive. A small jar of cookie butter found in a vending machine was five dollars!</p>
<ul>
<li>5 stars: appearance</li>
</ul>
<p>The place inside is beautiful and is artfully designed. The surrounding area is sketchy, though the facade of the building itself is modern and inviting. <a href="https://unionmarketdc.com">Union Market</a></p>

<h2 id="ikea-sleepovers">IKEA Sleepovers</h2>
<p>IKEA sleepovers are a new dare campaign, where customers stay over at IKEA. It seems really neat, however it is illegal for a person to stay overnight in a locked store. According to an Ikea UK spokesperson: “We appreciate that people are interested in Ikea and want to create fun experiences, however the safety and security of our co-workers and customers is our highest priority and that’s why we do not allow sleepovers in our stores.” There are some legal store run sleepovers that I am researching. I would just love to stay in the one below. But, I don’t think the sleepovers work like that.</p>
