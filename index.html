  <p><strong>5 stars- food quality</strong> </p>
  <p>I have never had any horribly tasting food there. The empanadas that I had in Union Market were scrumptious.</p>
  <p><strong>3 stars- affordability</strong> </p>
  <p>The price is steep. 10 dollars for three empanadas is pricey. Even their vending machine products were expensive. The cookie butter, a small jar, was five dollars!</p>
  <p><strong>5 stars- appearance</strong></p>
  <p>The place inside and out is beautiful and is artfully designed.</p>

  <h2>IKEA sleepovers</h2>
  <div id="text2">
  <p>IKEA sleepovers are a new dare campaign. It seems really neat, however it is illegal for a person to stay overnight in a locked store. According to an Ikea UK spokesperson: "We appreciate that people are interested in Ikea and want to create fun experiences, however the safety and security of our co-workers and customers is our highest priority and that's why we do not allow sleepovers in our stores." There are some legal store run sleepovers that I am researching. I would just love to stay in the one below. But, I don't think the sleepovers work like that.</p>

  <h2>Coding Classes</h2>
  <div id="text3">
  <p>I think that the class was worthwhile because that it tried to encourage girls that coding and computer science was a world for them. I just don't think it was worthwhile for me because I didn't need encouragement. In five weeks of classes, I learned two new things. I learned how to create web apps and how to change different features of a website. I don't know what else we are going to be learning, but I hope it will be soon! </p>

  <h2>Learning hangul</h2>
  <p>I am learning the Korean alphabet, Hangul. It is supposedly a very clever alphabet and the koreans are so proud of it that they have a day dedicated to celebrating it. I am using it to pronunce the labels on the Korean dumpling packet. It is actually quite easy. I've only started learning on Friday and I am getting quite good at it. If you want to learn, check out the websites in the description. Sorry that the visual is in french. It was the only one I found that could fit.</p>

  <h2>Math notes: 12.1</h2>
  <p>Polyhedrons- 3D bounded by concave polygons. Faces- enclose space. Edge- line segment formed by faces. Vertex- where 3+ faces meet. Regular- all are congruent regular polygons.</p>
  <h3>Euler's Theorem: F+V = E+2</h3>
  <h2>Platonic Solids</h2>
  <p>The first number is the number of faces. The second is vertices. The third is edges. </p>
  <p>- tetrahedron (4, 4, 6)</p>
  <p>- cube/hexahedron (6, 8, 12)</p>
  <p>- octohedron (8, 6, 12)</p>
  <p>- dodecahedron (12, 20, 30)</p>
  <p>- icosahedron (20, 12, 30)</p>

  <h2>Women who code meetups</h2>
  <p>There is one on python on the 19th of April. It happens to be in DC at 6:30. It seems really lit. There are other ones, but I really want to do this one because it is about the language I am learning. It is only open to people who identify as a female.</p>
  <h2>Whipped Cream Recipe</h2>
  <p>The recipe of the site below is really helpful. The next time I will maybe add chocolate powder. This time I added vanilla which made the whipped cream smell really good. I put it on pudding.</p>
