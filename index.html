    <h3> Union Market- favorite place to eat!</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
    <li>5 stars: food quality</li>
    <di>I have never had any horribly tasting food there. The empanadas that I had in Union Market were scrumptious.</di>
    <li>2 stars: affordability</li>
    <p>The price is steep. 10 dollars for three empanadas is pricey. Even their vending machine products were expensive. A small jar of cookie butter found in a vending machine was five dollars!</p>
    <li>5 stars: appearance</li>
    <p>The place inside is beautiful and is artfully designed. The surrounding area is sketchy... though the facade of the building itself is modern and inviting.</p>

    <h2>IKEA sleepovers</h2>
      <p>IKEA sleepovers are a new dare campaign, where customers stay over at IKEA. It seems really neat, however it is illegal for a person to stay overnight in a locked store. According to an Ikea UK spokesperson: "We appreciate that people are interested in Ikea and want to create fun
        experiences, however the safety and security of our co-workers and customers is our highest priority and that's why we do not allow sleepovers in our stores." There are some legal store run sleepovers that I am researching. I would just love to
        stay in the one below. But, I don't think the sleepovers work like that.</p>

    <h2>Women who code meetups</h2>
    <p>There is one on python on the 19th of April. It happens to be in DC at 6:30. It seems really lit. There are other ones, but I really want to do this one because it is about the language I am learning. It is only open to people who identify as a female.</p>
    <h2>Whipped Cream Recipe</h2>
    <p>The recipe of the site below is really helpful. The next time I will maybe add chocolate powder. This time I added vanilla which made the whipped cream smell really good. I put it on pudding.</p>
